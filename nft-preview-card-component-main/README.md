## My Process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

##### CSS
- I learnt more on **pseudo classes and elements** and how best to apply them for the hover states.
- I learnt about **image overlay effects** with this challenge.
- I learnt more about **CSS positioning**.
- i learnt about the best way to use **svg icons**.

##### Scss
- I learnt how to work with the **.scss** file and how to watch sass live with VS code.
- I learnt Scss features **(nesting selectors, variables, storing maps in variables, usage of ampersand sign, media queries).**
- I learnt about how to retrieve variables within a map with the **map-get function.** 

##### Markdown
- I learnt how to write README.md files for the first time.

### Continued development

These are some of the concepts I need to work on in future projects which needs to be refined:
- Psuedo classes and elements.
- Nested properties in Scss.
- Image overlay effects.
